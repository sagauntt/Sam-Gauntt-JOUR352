    <h1>Black, multi-racial students most likely to face hateful speech in schools, survey finds </h1>
    <h2>A 2018 incident at Glenelg High School in Howard County spurred discussions about hate speech in schools across Maryland .</h2>
    <h3>By Sam Gauntt</h3>
    <p>In 2018, four white students vandalized the grounds of Glenelg High School in Howard County, Maryland with racist, homophobic and anti-Semetic graffiti, spurring discussions on hate-related speech and vandalism in schools. At Glenelg High School, less than 5% of the student body is Black, despite more than 20% of the county being Black. 
    
    A 2019 report from the National Center for Education Statistics found that Black and multi-racial students were the most likely to encounter or see hate-related speech or vandalism in schools.</p>
