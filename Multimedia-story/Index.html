            The principal saw a swastika first. It was inky black, spray-painted on a trash can just beside the entrance
            to the high school. David Burton switched off the engine of his SUV, unaware, even then, of the magnitude of
            what he was about to see. <br />
            <br />
            This was the last day of the year for the Class of 2018 at Glenelg High School. There was going to be an
            awards ceremony, a picnic, that end-of-a-journey feeling that always made Burton so proud of his job. But as
            he was on his way to work at 6:25 a.m., the assistant principal had called, agitated and yelling about
            graffiti. “It’s everywhere,” he kept saying, so Burton had leaned on the gas and rushed the last few
            miles.<br /><br />
            Soon, everyone would be telling him how shocked they were. This was Howard County, after all: a Maryland
            suburb between Washington and Baltimore that is extremely diverse, extremely well-educated and home to
            Columbia, a planned community founded on the principles of integration and inclusion. People moved their
            families here for that reputation just as much as for the good schools.<br /><br />
            “Pleasantville,” Burton liked to call it, but as a black man, and as the principal of the county’s only
            majority-white high school, he knew this place was more complicated. When he stepped out into the bright
            spring day, he confronted the reality of just how much more.<br /><br />
            Beneath his dress shoes, there were more swastikas. Spray painted around them were crude drawings of
            penises.<br /><br />
            Then Burton saw the letters “KKK.” He saw the word “Fuck” again and again next to the words “Jews,” “Fags,”
            “Nigs” and “Burton.”<br /><br />

        <p class="bodytext">
            He kept walking, following the graffiti around the building’s perimeter. It was on the sidewalks, the trash
            cans, the loading dock, the stadium around back. There were more than 100 markings in total, though he
            didn’t bother to count. <br /><br />
            He turned a corner and saw something written in large capital letters on the sidewalk: “BURTON IS A NIGGER.”
            <br /><br />He paused only for a moment, looking at the words, trying to comprehend that all of this was
            real.<br /><br />
            Later, school district officials, county administrators and prosecutors would have a name for what happened
            here. They would repeat it, condemn it and vow to prevent it from occurring again. <i>Hate crime</i>.
            <br /><br />The phrase has become inescapable as hate-fueled incidents have spiked across the country. A
            quarter of all hate crimes reported to the FBI, more than any other category, are similar to the attack
            discovered at Glenelg on May 24, 2018. Vandalism and destruction of property, a physical marking of an
            age-old threat: You don’t belong here.<br /><br />
            The majority are repaired, washed away or painted over without anyone arrested. When the perpetrators are
            caught, they are rarely charged with a hate crime. Here, there would be consequences, and with them, a
            division between those who wanted to confront the racism in their midst and those determined to explain it
            away.<br /><br />
            But first, Burton, 50 years old and dressed in one of his best black suits, would walk back over the
            graffiti, retreat into his office, close the door and pray.<br /><br />
            His staff scrambled to cover the spray paint with tarps, carpet pads, anything they could find. The
            maintenance team searched for a sandblaster. But there was too much to cover and too little time before the
            students and parents began arriving. The seniors were wearing red caps and gowns, ready for their awards
            ceremony. Everyone was directed to alternative entrances, away from the worst of the damage. But photos of
            the graffiti were already being texted, emailed and Snapchatted.<br /><br />
