                    <p class="bodytext">
                        The principal saw a swastika first. It was inky black, spray-painted on a trash can just beside
                        the entrance to the high school. David Burton switched off the engine of his SUV, unaware, even
                        then, of the magnitude of what he was about to see. <br />
                        <br />
                        This was the last day of the year for the Class of 2018 at Glenelg High School. There was going
                        to be an awards ceremony, a picnic, that end-of-a-journey feeling that always made Burton so
                        proud of his job. But as he was on his way to work at 6:25 a.m., the assistant principal had
                        called, agitated and yelling about graffiti. “It’s everywhere,” he kept saying, so Burton had
                        leaned on the gas and rushed the last few miles.<br /><br />
                        Soon, everyone would be telling him how shocked they were. This was Howard County, after all: a
                        Maryland suburb between Washington and Baltimore that is extremely diverse, extremely
                        well-educated and home to Columbia, a planned community founded on the principles of integration
                        and inclusion. People moved their families here for that reputation just as much as for the good
                        schools.<br /><br />
                        “Pleasantville,” Burton liked to call it, but as a black man, and as the principal of the
                        county’s only majority-white high school, he knew this place was more complicated. When he
                        stepped out into the bright spring day, he confronted the reality of just how much more.<br /><br />
                        Beneath his dress shoes, there were more swastikas. Spray painted around them were crude
                        drawings of penises.<br /><br />
                        Then Burton saw the letters “KKK.” He saw the word “Fuck” again and again next to the words
                        “Jews,” “Fags,” “Nigs” and “Burton.”<br /><br />
                    </p>
                    <p class="bodytext">
                        He kept walking, following the graffiti around the building’s perimeter. It was on the
                        sidewalks, the trash cans, the loading dock, the stadium around back. There were more than 100
                        markings in total, though he didn’t bother to count. <br /><br />
                        He turned a corner and saw something written in large capital letters on the sidewalk: “BURTON
                        IS A NIGGER.”
                        <br /><br />He paused only for a moment, looking at the words, trying to comprehend that all of
                        this was real.<br /><br />
                        Later, school district officials, county administrators and prosecutors would have a name for
                        what happened here. They would repeat it, condemn it and vow to prevent it from occurring again.
                        <i>Hate crime</i>. <br /><br />The phrase has become inescapable as hate-fueled incidents have
                        spiked across the country. A quarter of all hate crimes reported to the FBI, more than any other
                        category, are similar to the attack discovered at Glenelg on May 24, 2018. Vandalism and
                        destruction of property, a physical marking of an age-old threat: You don’t belong here.<br /><br />
                        The majority are repaired, washed away or painted over without anyone arrested. When the
                        perpetrators are caught, they are rarely charged with a hate crime. Here, there would be
                        consequences, and with them, a division between those who wanted to confront the racism in their
                        midst and those determined to explain it away.<br /><br />
                        But first, Burton, 50 years old and dressed in one of his best black suits, would walk back over
                        the graffiti, retreat into his office, close the door and pray.<br /><br />
                        His staff scrambled to cover the spray paint with tarps, carpet pads, anything they could find.
                        The maintenance team searched for a sandblaster. But there was too much to cover and too little
                        time before the students and parents began arriving. The seniors were wearing red caps and
                        gowns, ready for their awards ceremony. Everyone was directed to alternative entrances, away
                        from the worst of the damage. But photos of the graffiti were already being texted, emailed and
                        Snapchatted.<br /><br />

                        In the auditorium, Imani Nokuri looked for her family, who had come to see her perform the
                        national anthem. She was one of fewer than 20 black students in the class of more than 260
                        seniors. She and her younger sister, a freshman at Glenelg, had been rapid-fire texting all
                        morning, comforting each other. But when Imani saw the look of deep concern her grandmother gave
                        her, she forced a smile onto her face. “It’s okay,” she promised. “I’m fine.”<br />
                        In the central office, teachers who had led diversity and empathy training for students were
                        crying. Police were arriving, asking to see security footage. Phones were ringing with calls
                        from reporters. Photos of the damage were about to be broadcast on TV, making their way into
                        homes across the region.<br />
                        In one of those homes, 72-year-old Susan Sands-Joseph was watching. She knew Glenelg well. She
                        was one of the first black students to attend the school after desegregation. Suddenly, all the
                        memories that she tried not to dwell on were dredged up again: the words she was called, the
                        tomatoes thrown at her head, the looks her parents gave her when she came home saying scalding
                        hot soup had been pushed into her lap again. “It’s okay,” she had promised them. “I’m fine.”<br />
                        By the time the awards ceremony was about to begin, Principal Burton had rewritten the speech he
                        had been planning to give. “We are not going to let this ruin your celebration,” he would now
                        tell students.<br />
                        He emerged from his office with notes clutched in his hand and stopped to check in with the
                        police. The security footage, they told Burton, confirmed what he had suspected.<br />
                        The principal entered the auditorium to a burst of applause. He stepped up to the podium. He
                        stood before his students, looked out into their faces and felt certain: The people who did this
                        were looking back at him. Seth Taylor tipped his head down so his graduation cap would block his
                        view of the podium. It felt, he said later, like the principal was staring right at him. But he
                        and the others had hidden their faces behind masks the night before, Seth reminded himself. How
                        could anyone know they were the ones who had done it?<br />
                        All morning, he had been replaying the vandalism in his mind. He’d been at his buddy Matt Lipp’s
                        house, where the parents of all their friends had gathered the evening of May 23 to sort out the
                        details of Senior Week. The teens’ parents had rented them a house in Ocean City, the annual
                        destination for thousands of local students celebrating graduation, and were divvying up tasks:
                        who would drive the group to the beach, who would stock their fridge, who would cook them
                        dinners before leaving them for a week of beer pong, sunburns and meetups with houses full of
                        girls.<br />
                        Afterward, Seth stayed to watch a Washington Capitals playoff game. He loved these kinds of
                        nights and, really, everything about high school. Cheering crowds at his football and baseball
                        games, late-night Xbox sessions, fishing trips, parties in their parents’ basements. He could do
                        without the academic part — he was a B student, at best — but he was planning to join the Army
                        Reserve and maybe go to community college.<br />
                        With him at Matt’s was Josh Shaffer, a hockey player he’d been friends with since seventh grade,
                        and Tyler Curtiss, the baseball team captain who had been homecoming king and prom king.<br />
                        Matt and Josh declined interview requests, but Seth and Tyler agreed to talk to The Washington
                        Post about the vandalism. When they tell the story of that evening, they start with the end of
                        the Caps game, when everyone but Seth was deep into a supply of Bud Light, and the conversation
                        turned, once again, to their senior prank.
